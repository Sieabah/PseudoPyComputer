## PseudoPyClient

This project was written while working for a library in their IT department. This code was originally written in 2015 and
nothing has changed from that time. I don't guarantee it will work or that it is written in any reasonable way. It was 
primarily used as a tool to simulate PCs and have a GUI so you can mutate those simulated machines and see if the API was updated.

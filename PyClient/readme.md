## Python Inventory Client Simulator

Written by Christopher Sidell

### Description

This program essentially runs as a demo to show the api/web front ends with simulated client computers. It also allows for a simulated stress test by running this on many computers to connect to one inventory instance.

Please read the documentation in the docs folder to learn more about configuring the pyclient to help demo/test your setup.
